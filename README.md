# Traffic Signs Classification with EfficientNetB1

## Description
This project focuses on classifying traffic signs using a fine-tuned EfficientNetB1 model developed by Google. The model is trained on custom data to accurately classify various traffic signs. The classification is integrated into a web application built using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed.
- Basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts.
- Familiarity with Flask, HTML, and CSS.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub 'https://github.com/Vikas-ABD/traffic_signs_classification'.
2. Set up a virtual environment for the project 'python -m venv venv'.
3. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Train the EfficientNetB1 model with custom traffic sign data. The training dataset should include a diverse range of traffic signs under various environmental conditions to ensure robust classification.
2. Save the trained model in .h5 format for future use. Ensure that the model is adequately evaluated and tested for accuracy and performance.
3. Run the Flask application using the command `python app.py`. Ensure that the Flask server is running correctly.
4. Upload an image of a traffic sign to the web application for classification. Ensure that the image is clear and well-captured to obtain accurate results.
5. View the classification result on the web application interface. Evaluate the classification accuracy and make necessary adjustments to improve performance.
